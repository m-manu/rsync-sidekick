## Introduction

`rsync` is a fantastic tool. Yet, by itself, it's a pain to use for repeated backing up of media files (videos, music,
photos, etc.) _that are reorganized frequently_.

`rsync-sidekick` is a safe and simple tool that is designed to run **before** `rsync` is run.

## What does this do?

`rsync-sidekick` propagates following changes (or any combination) from _source directory_ to _destination directory_:

1. Change in file modification timestamp
2. Rename of file/directory
3. Moving a file from one directory to another

Note:

* This tool **does not delete** any files or folders (under any circumstances) -- that's why safe-to-use ðŸ˜Œ
    * Your files are just _moved around_
    * Now, if you're uncomfortable with this tool even moving your files around, there is a `--shellscript` option, that
      just generates a script for you to read and run (think of it like a `--dry-run` option)
* This tool **does not** actually **transfer** files -- that's for `rsync` to do ðŸ™‚
* Since you'd run `rsync` after this tool is run, any changes that this tool couldn't propagate would just be propagated
  by `rsync`
    * So the most that you might lose is some time with `rsync` doing more work than it could have -- Which is likely
      still much less than not using this tool at all ðŸ˜„

## How to install?

1. Install Go version at least **1.22**
    * On Ubuntu: `snap install go`
    * On Mac: `brew install go`
    * For anything else: [Go downloads page](https://go.dev/dl/)
2. Run command:
   ```bash
   go install github.com/m-manu/rsync-sidekick@latest
   ```
3. Add following line in your `.bashrc`/`.zshrc` file:
   ```bash
   export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/go/bin"
   ```

## How to use?

**Step 1**: Run this tool

```bash
rsync-sidekick /Users/manu/Photos/ /Volumes/Portable/Photos/
```

**Step 2**: Run `rsync` as you would normally do

```bash
# Note the trailing slashes below. Without them, rsync's behavior is different!
rsync -av /Users/manu/Photos/ /Volumes/Portable/Photos/ 
```

## Command line options

Running `rsync-sidekick --help` displays following information:

```
rsync-sidekick is a tool to propagate file renames, movements and timestamp changes from a source directory to a destination directory.

Usage:
	 rsync-sidekick <flags> [source-dir] [destination-dir]

where,
	[source-dir]        Source directory
	[destination-dir]   Destination directory

flags: (all optional)
  -x, --exclusions string            path to file containing newline separated list of file/directory names to be excluded
                                     (even if this is not set, files/directories such these will still be ignored: $RECYCLE.BIN, desktop.ini, Thumbs.db etc.)
  -h, --help                         display help
      --list                         list files along their metadata for given directory
  -s, --shellscript                  instead of applying changes directly, generate a shell script
                                     (this flag is useful if you want 'dry run' this tool or want to run the shell script as a different user)
  -p, --shellscript-at-path string   similar to --shellscript option but you can specify output script path
                                     (this flag cannot be specified if --shellscript option is specified)
  -v, --verbose                      generates extra information, even a file dump (caution: makes it slow!)
      --version                      show application version (v1.5.0) and exit

## Running this from a Docker container

Below is a simple example:

```shell
# Run rsync-sidekick:
docker run --rm -v /Users/manu:/mnt/homedir manumk/rsync-sidekick rsync-sidekick /mnt/homedir/Photos/ /mnt/homedir/Photos_backup/

# Then run rsync: (note the trailing slashes -- without them, rsync's behavior is different)
docker run --rm -v /Users/manu:/mnt/homedir manumk/rsync-sidekick rsync /mnt/homedir/Photos/ /mnt/homedir/Photos_backup/
```

## FAQs

### Why was this tool created?

`rsync` options such as `--detect-renamed`, `--detect-renamed-lax`, `--detect-moved` and `--fuzzy` don't work reliably
and sometimes are dangerous! `rsync-sidekick` is reliable alternative to all these options and much more.

### How will I benefit from using this tool?

Using `rsync-sidekick` before `rsrync` makes your backup process significantly faster than using only `rsync`. Sometimes
this performance benefit can even be 100xðŸ˜², if the only changes at your _source directory_ are the 3 types mentioned
earlier in this article.
